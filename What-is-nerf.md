# Neural Radiance Fields

Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a technique that generates 3D representations of an object or scene from 2D images by using machine learning. The technique involves encoding the entire object or scene into a neural network, which predicts the radiance at any point in the space to generate novel 3D views from different angles.
