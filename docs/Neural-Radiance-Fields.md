# Neural Radiance Fields

Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a technique that generates 3D representations of an object or scene from 2D images by using machine learning. The technique involves encoding the entire object or scene into a neural network, which predicts the radiance at any point in the space to generate novel 3D views from different angles.

Neural rendering

Great for reflective materials

meshing is pretty much the same as normal photogrammetry

using marching cubes

no special rendering

it looks like it can render reflective surfaces, but this is not true when we look at the generated meshes
